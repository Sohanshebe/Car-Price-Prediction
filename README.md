# Car Price Prediction with Jupyter Notebook

## Project Overview
Car Price Prediction with Jupyter Notebook is a machine learning project designed to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as mileage, brand, model year, fuel type, and more. Leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms, this project aims to assist car buyers, sellers, and dealerships in estimating the fair market value of pre-owned vehicles.

## Data Source
The project utilizes a dataset containing information about used cars, including their specifications and selling prices. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating machine learning models for car price prediction.

## Key Objectives
The main objectives of this project include:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the data for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution, correlation, and patterns present in the car features.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identifying relevant features and engineering new ones to improve the predictive performance of the models.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Building and training machine learning models to predict car prices based on the available features.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques.

## Tools and Technologies
This project makes use of the following tools and technologies:
- **Python:** Programming language used for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive computational environment for executing Python code and conducting data analysis.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation library for working with structured data.
- **NumPy:** Library for numerical computing and array operations.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for building and evaluating predictive models.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Visualization libraries for creating insightful plots and charts.
